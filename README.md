# Snowdog Front-end Recruitment test

* Please do not use fake Github accounts, we want to check your contributions history since we use and create open source.
* We are not answering any questions about this test. Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
* If you think that some part of this test is weirdly old-fashioned or not described precisely, there is a very high chance it's on purpose, because we want to test you in a way worse environment than you will work on a daily basis.

## Before you start
Fork this repository, it needs to stay on Github, available for everyone.

The test is based on [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) a full stack Node.js framework.

After runing a `dev` script, you should see start page on http://localhost:3333/.
